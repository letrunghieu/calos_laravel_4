# Turning on the rewrite engine is necessary for the following rules and
# features. "+FollowSymLinks" must be enabled for this to work symbolically.

<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
	Options +FollowSymLinks
	RewriteEngine On

# For all files not found in the file system, reroute the request to the
# "index.php" front controller, keeping the query string intact

	RewriteRule ^(.*)$ /public/$1 [L]
